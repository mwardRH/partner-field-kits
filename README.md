# Partner Field Kits

What I am trying to do is deepen our connection with select Red Hat partners by defining what documents Red Hat field teams and Partner field teams will need to be successful, committing to a "content sprint" to timebox the development of the materials, then taking that material and promoting it. The content that is generated could be used to enhance existing product/solutions conversation.
